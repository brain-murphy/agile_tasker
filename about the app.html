		About The App
	</h3>
	<p>
    This app was made for the purpose of time management. It's services will help you keep track of the confusing world while helping you
    keep track of time. It will alert you and estimate about how much time it will take you to finish certain tasks. Depending
    on how long it will take you to finish it will prioritize your activity autonomously and alert you every time even earlier than when
    you need it so you are prepared.
